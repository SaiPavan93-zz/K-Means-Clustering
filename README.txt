1)The code is written in Pythom 3.5 and is tested in Tesla (python 2.7)

2)The code must be run as follows 
		python trial.py testfile2.txt 3  OR
		python trial.py testfile3.txt 5 centroidfile.txt
		
3)The first argument specifies the input file and the next corresponds to the total desired clusters and the next is the centroid file.

4)NOTE : The centroid file centroid points must be specified with respect to the size of dataset as the default size of the dataset is taken as 150.So, no value exceeds 150.
The value of k must be same as the length or the number of points in centroidfile.txt
